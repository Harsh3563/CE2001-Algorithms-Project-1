# CE2001-Project-1-
Codes based on the "Brute-force sequential search" method and "KMP algorithm" for determining exact occurrences of a query sequence in a DNA sequence (the "SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1" and "homo-sapiens" genomes)

Instructions to GenomeSearch (The code implementing KMP algorithm)

1. Place the genome file to search through inside the project folder.
2. Rename the file to "Genome.fna".
3. Launch the project with your IDE. (eclipse is the one we coded with)
4. When code runs, at the start there will be some time used to process the Genome file, 
please wait patiently for prompt to input your sequence to search for.
5. The positions of the sequence will be output.
6. When the message "No more Sequences found !!" is printed, search has ended and 
all positions have already been displayed.
7. Execution time for only the search sequence will also be displayed.
(The time taken to process the file is not included in the execution time)
